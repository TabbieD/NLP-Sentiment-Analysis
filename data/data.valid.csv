__label__suicidal,i think i m ready for the long sleep i tried to commit suicide on friday didn t work i m so tired i just want to go now
__label__suicidal,8th grade i m in 8th grade and already contemplating this shit the reason i have been thinking about this is i have anxiety and depression that never seems to go away i can t talk to my parents about it because they have my other two brothers to worry about so the only way to help myself is to hurt them and i don t think i can do that and i m afraid to reach out to a friend cause i feel like we could never have a normal conversation again then there s the fact that i know i m going to grow up to be a man child who at best is a manager of a bar or gas station even though i want to do something with science but even the thought of responsibility scares me i have all fs in my core classes because we just moved and i feel my parents are slowly giving up on me i just can t take this shit anymore
__label__suicidal,trying this to vent dont know what to do anymore first of all i want to say that english isnt my native language so please forgive any mistakes i makei am trying this a sort of last resort in the last 10 years i am almost 21 now i have experienced in those years many beautiful and precious moments but also horrible ones i was bullied in i think extreme ways for 3 years and that fucked me up for a while depression therapy and the like that was the first time i was suicidal and i also thought that was my rock bottom i changed schools and i lost weight and made many friends those 2 years were the best of my life i got a girlfriend that left me after 2 years in really mean way i also made mistakes but the way she left me she deliberately made my life hell made me think about ending it again that brings us to last year i chose a gap year because i didnt know what to study i also applied for a job which i got it s a job for students so the whole ambiance is very social our own pub and partys and the like that job dragged me right out of that depression and i made so many friends months later i met a girl a sister of a colleague haha and she rocked my world of course i have friends to whom i can say everything but she was something else she knows everything about me and i know everything about her the sister is also one of my closest friends i have but m the girl stills lives at her parents and 2 hours away so one day we excited to meet in secret parents were away and we ended up having sex until this day the sister doesnt know it we met a second time and we seriously fell in love but she lives 2 hours away her parents are abusive she is not in a good place too the big sister is in a depression so if she finds out about this well lets say that it wont end well m chose to end things not because of me she was never so in love as with me but because she thinks that the relationship isnt gonna work my reaction to this was drinking and partying everyday im drunk almost every evening i lost my job and thus also the social things with the job because of this and some other shit i simply dont know what to do anymore everything is failing im failing my classes im a burden to my parents and friends also to m because al those people are gonna go to shit because of my pain i cant end myself because i will fuck their lives up but i want it so damn bad every minute not drinking is living hell i am a failure
__label__suicidal,too many things out of my control hithanks for clicking my apologies for venting on the internet i just had no idea where else to go in fact i should be studying for tomorrow s exami am a upperclassman in college who has been suicidal since high school this is likely due to the fact that i suffer from depression yet there are so many impeding factors in my life that are dragging me down by the necka lot of people refer to college as the best time of their lives yet i am completely wasting it every weekend i am by myself in my room wasting time on the internet or doing homework i do not have a social life and i am so socially stunted that i do not know how to build oneacademically i am performing well for the most part unfortunately i managed to get three wds on my transcript because i refused to play the stupid game putting up with classes taught by terrible professors i refused to stay in a place where the professors were of no help i attempted a second stem major along with my current stem major because my school offers a program where i would have gone to an ivy league school for two years after my senior year i gave up on the program during my second semester in it leaving me feeling like a complete failuresleeping is difficult for me recently it has become easier but before it took such an incredibly long time for me to fall asleep at one point i resorted to hitting my head against the wall to make myself sleepyi m undocumented in the usa because of certain circumstances i cannot renew my daca and will begin accruing illegal time when march roles around i lived in this country for 17 years and there is the danger i will be kicked out of my home my parents are undocumented too if they get caught and deported while i m at college which is in a different state there will be no one left at home to take care of little siblings who are american born citizensbecause i am undocumented at a conservative college a lot of students publicly hate immigrants like me though they do not know of my status this impedes against me going out to socialize i can t go to parties because i cannot enjoy the activities without fear of getting caught arrested and deported because i am underageone way to solve my immigrant status would be to get sponsorship i have been interning at a prestigious company for two summers now and have been offered a third internship i was hoping to do well enough at this internship to get hired and later become sponsored but because my daca is expiring i will be unable work in the usa by summertimei am infatuated with an undocumented girl i cannot even attempt to build a romantic relationship with her because marriage is another way to attain a pathway to citizenship i do not want to get married for papers but for love it just sucks that i have to force myself to lose my infatuation with this girl and move one so i can eventually marry an american citizen assuming i can find someone desperate enough to marry memy life is a soap opera cliche turns out i have a halfsibling i found out about this sibling after i started college one parent cheated on the other and they were born it is possible my cheating parent is sending them money to attend the most expensive university in my home country while they study for a fucking communications majortherapy isn t helping i m currently on another type of antidepressants because the last ones failed my counselor constantly tells me about the plethora of positive qualities i possess ranging from intelligence to empathy yet every time i feel an iota of hope or positivity it quickly evaporatesi have this unnatural fear that i will be forgotten when i die this keeps me from trying anything because i keep reverting to the same thought of what s the pointto conclude i am so fucking scared of everything i do not know what my future brings if it will actually bring anything at all i find myself miserable in my home state my college state and i know i will be miserable in my home country if i get deported is there any advice or hope that someone can offer without repeating the same asinine rhetoric that gets tossed around
__label__suicidal,so much built up i don t know where to start i went to my doctor today for a followup from an appointment a week ago these appointments have nothing to do with depression or suicide but the nurse asks questions about it because i have a history twice last year i was out on disability from work while i went through outpatient therapybut when i answered the questions and openly admitted to my current mental state being very shaky it was never brought up again no followup from the doctor at all makes me feel like it really doesn t matteri lost my job in june that i had for 10 years i was blindsided and i was betrayed i have a lot of anger still festering about how things were handled i was unemployed for a month and a half before a temp agency found me a job it was a job below my level of expertise but i was gratefulfor it 4 days in my dad goes to the hospital for an unknown illness three weeks later he died of lung cancer this leads to two things 1 i am missing a ton of time from my new job while my dad is in the hospital and then eventually on hospice at home 2 my dad died and i m his power of attorneypersonal representative so at first i m dealing with medical decisions and then he died and i am dealing with the estate while trying to get a normal work schedule backdid i mention none of my excoworkers from as little as 2 months ago reached out to send condolences fuck them rightit doesn t work out though and they let me go at the end of the temp period so i m jobless again here s the thing they started scheduling interviews for my job while i was working it and telling me that they didn t know anything about the end of my contract just treated me like an idiotthe whole time this is going on i am losing 80 pounds without trying i had digestive issues that started before my first job loss and we are still figuring it outand i m type 2 diabetic nowit s been a shit summer going into a shit fall in depressed i m angry i m anxious i m overwhelmed and i m just needing it to end some way our anotherthat s my story

__label__suicidal,advice needed i was diagnosed with mdd and for the past month almost all my thoughts have either been self hating or planning talking myself into my suicide my family knows hardly anything about my troubles i am very good at keeping things to myself through years of experience imagine if your 20 year old came and told you i ve been suicidal for almost a decade have more than a dozen attempts and mdd it would be truly heart breaking it would almost come out of nowhere to them sometimes i think the truth may be better hidden i don t think i can live a decent life i am not capable of it i hurt people without realizing it how can i be a good person i think one of the most important things in life is human connections but what if you have trouble making them please someone help i am very much on the edge i would appreciate an older parent s perspective on all of this
__label__suicidal,autismrelated disorder makes me want to die not sure if this is the right place to post i have a disorder related to autism and as a result connecting with or relating to people on the same level as everyone else is basically impossible even saying hi to strangers passing on the sidewalk is terrifying literally part of my diagnosis is that i will always be excessively quiet and have very few friends i can t not let my diagnosis define me as people like to say when my behavior is predestined and incurable every day is filled with humiliation and isolation and though i ve tried for years to fight the coldness and loneliness and isolation that surrounds me tried to fix or accept myself this feeling of meaninglessness never leaves i ve had a history of depression since i was 12 and though it s been lowlevel for many years i doubt it will ever go away by this point given that i m 20 now the only real reason i don t kill myself is so i won t make my mom upset given that she does so much for me already i thought about crashing into an empty car as i was driving home and veered near it not entirely seriously but it would break her heart and cost the other person greatly similarly swallowing a bottle of pills would traumatize the family being in a relationship temporarily made things feel worthwhile but i m not eager to start dating again someone sticking with me as long as my ex did was really unusual literature arts give me a small sense of meaning but it s ephemeral and fleeting a blink of passion and it s over nothing has made living this life truly worth it nothing has given me lasting warmth 
__label__suicidal,i don t want to die i just don t want to work 40 hours i plan to end my life soon just because i can t seem to find a job that i m willing to do for the majority of my life i wouldn t mind working at most places 4 or even 6 hours a day but 8 hours just seems like more than i can handle i think that if i could find a job that payed enough for just 6 hours a day i might be able to keep going but these don t seem to exist
__label__suicidal,my reason for not killing myself is kind of silly most people s reason for not killing themselves is probably because they have kids or a pet and they need to take care of them or their family or friends would miss them but not me my reason is because it would hurt or otherwise be very uncomfortable i know it s dumbyou know what else is dumb i go to a great school have a nice twostory house with a swimming pool in the backyard a laptop a 3ds parents who love me and a friend and boyfriend who are some of the kindest people i ve ever met but i m depressed and suicidali guess i should also tell you why i m suicidal i have aspergers which i absolutely hate i also have really bad adhd both get in the way of life i m also an annoying little crapsicle so i guess that s why i m suicidal
__label__suicidal,i am really not feeling ok i want to talk to someone who has felt similar to me i posted here a while ago but honestly my issues are just getting worse i genuinely genuinely believe i am the ugliest guy i know i cannot bear to even look at myself in the mirror and videospictures are horrifyingi m 24 live with three other guys they all have girls regularly i haven t had sex in 3 yearspeople say subtle things about my looks all the time like i m goofy or look like a cartoon character which seems simple at the time but it crushes my self esteemi don t like going out anymore because i have zero self esteem i spent the last 30 minutes taking videos of myself just to confirm i m ugly the one side of my face is literally deformed and looks ridiculousi had a girlfriend for 2 years 2 years ago and she was incredible and was the only thing that made me happy people told me she was far out of my league all the time she left me of coursei just don t know what to do i wake up every day feeling soooo uncomfortable in my own skin i ve slowly realized over time that i truly am a really ugly person without a doubt to be honest i just don t really want to live anymore other people are always having fun when i m suffering in my own skin feeling uncomfortable i can only do this for so much longer i just don t want to live out the rest of my life i ve been terrified of suicide but as i live each day i grow a little more miserable and one more step closer to finally doing itthere s nothing i can do to fix the way i look this is me i hate myself

__label__suicidal,my mom is the only person in the world who would care if i died everyone always leaves despite what they say i m always begging for people to care but no one even cares 
__label__suicidal,i just feel like unwanted and useless decoration i just wish i was never born when i think about it there s no one for whom i make life better  just the reverse my life hasn t done anything good for anyone i guess all my friends and family members would be better off without someone constantly just causing problems and being one big problem i feel that there s just no place for me in this world  and i have really tried looking for it doesn t matter where i m always a misfitthe best i could say about myself is that i m probably pretty but even that i ruined with all my self harm  so there s nothing left i feel like unwanted and useless decoration what s it worth to be pretty if you re just a disaster besides thatpeople just always leave me  and if they wouldn t my fear and knowing that they will in the end ensures it  or at least the important persons the ones i actually really care about my life always just got better to only get even worse afterwards but i see an end soon in the moment i don t even have the strength to properly and seriously consider suicide  because even that seems senseless  but i ve recently just accepted that this will be my end maybe it will even last some more years but this is how it s gonna end every time something happens i m a bit closer to ending it and there s not much left til i ll finally do it i don t see anything left i could do i can t have any relationships anymore i d like to be a person that could just focus on her career but i m too unconcentrated too distracted too tired too depressed so i m just existing and waitingnot even therapists have been any help even they don t seem able to understand me and all the standard things aren t working on me my current doesn t even want to make the diagnosis because for her it seems like a lot of things  but then again not hundred percent one of them so i don t even have some simple words on a paper describing my problem she doesn t seem to care that i d like to know i should better call her the last one because this week i just didn t go for the first time  i saw no sense in this and i guess even she is sick of dealing with me everyone just expects me to hold on try out new things blaaa for them it s very easy and they can t understand why i m not full of hope because you re still so youngi m taking two antidepressants and have already tried two before it meditation sports i hate sports everything is useless i just don t know what to do it just hurts to be alive i don t want to be here

__label__suicidal,should i say goodbye i think you should tell people how you feel i think suicide is a permanent option that most of the time results out of a temporary issue you re going to die that s true and i m in no position to judge how that happens but to do it by your own hand is taking fate and whatever else we take for granted away you re consciously taking away tomorrow and tomorrow all your problems could just go awayyou also write about saying goodbye which makes me believe you obviously have people that care about you and in turn you must care about them do you really never want to see your friends family or whoever again do you really not want them to witness your success and your future do not be irrational about this death is the thing you have to be most rational about it s cliche but the evidence tells us you only live briefly in this tiny gap of life between two infinite voids of darkness this could be it buddy and you re going to end it early if you truly believe this and think this way and you re utterly convinced and you think it is the only possible solution bearing in mind people with terminal illnesses and life sentences often decide again it then you ve got to at least talk to someone someone you care about about what you re going through and why it s only fair to the ones you lovepersonally i d say life is a lot more profitable than death because you re here and it s now death will come just wait that s all you have to do from damning the ones you love to a lifetime of sadness and regret it s also good for you because meditating on this fact means you ll realise that you re not tied down to anything problems are only ephemeral you can tackle themi hope you talk to someone death doesn t hold an answer it is only an inevitability
__label__suicidal,dealing with suicidal thoughts alone i have 0 friends and i m not exaggerating one bit when i say that i m going through a bunch of shit now have been for a month and its hit its peak i have stress response syndrome so i cannot cope with anything at all first off on my list of things i m only 19 have agoraphobia and severe anxiety so i can t get a job or go out whatsoever i barely managed to graduate high school i have a abusive household that i can t escape cause my agoraphobia and i m attached i recently found out a good friend of mine has been manipulating me so i cut them off a few weeks ago then i had to cut my bestfriend off because they didn t wanna be friends cause my struggles are too much for them it does t help that they were always hanging out with my ex that i still haven t gotten over so really it s good i d like to think all the people who have been causing me grief are essentially gone but now i m alone and fighting to breath by myself i m scared and i don t want to be miserable forever i have a doctors appointment in 2 weeks and i don t know how i ll make it sorry this post is a mess i really need to make friends but its so hard for me
__label__suicidal,i can never have a good day i m abused at home the online friends i manage to make just bring me bad drama and hurt me failed attempts of social interactions at school ex friends that glance at me in the hallways and my anxiety that makes me look pathetic for a senior in high school honestly the only thing not making me pull the trigger is my yes online again because i m pathetic like that boyfriendi m tied between wishing i was never born and wishing i never met my boyfriend i love him but i just feel completely worthless i stay at home every chance i get he s the opposite i m a fucking loser that s just going to drag him down i don t even want to go to my graduation ceremony i fucking hate my school and everyone in it i want nothing else to do with this place everyone is fake causes drama just because they can has no regard for anyone else s feelings it s a society of morally low minded kids and i want to forget everyone there i want to start fresh after that

__label__suicidal,why do treat you like shit when trying to commit suicide edit i meant to say why do people i understand that most humans are angered at the idea of someone close decided to take their life away but when you re aware of how much joy you give to those by helping them out with their problems and ask for no reciprocation you can t stop but to ask yourself why the fuck are they treating me like shit i ve been institutionalize for suicide as a teen because my significant other preformed fellatio to a friend in front of me but ive never tried again ever since i have a ton of friends and i always put a smile upon them and it makes me happy it truly does but i m depressed and sometimes can t stop to think to dissappear no one s really reached out to me except one girlfriend but she overdosed on heroin so she s out of the picture i have a gf now but every time i tell her about something she has little to say or doesn t know what to say she makes me laugh and all but doesn t get me truly i do think about suicide from time to time but if i were to attempt again and fail i m sure i would get so much hate im not asking for help i just wanted to vent

__label__suicidal,i want to die but i don t someone help i have depression there are days when i don t want to get out of bed or i can t stop crying because what s the point in trying right i don t intend on killing myself although to be honest i ve found myself thinking more and more about how much easier it would be than my life right now to give you some background my year started okay going to college to follow my dream it wasn t great i failed the class pretty badly but i wasn t really trying that hard so i ended up dropping out of the course with the idea that i would try again and excel my boyfriend was an amazing person through all of this he was always there to give me advice comfort me when i cried give me an escape when my house was too much this summer i had two classes but had to drop one of them because my teacher would accommodate for my special needs which isn t that much i think extra time on tests and assignments and no presenting in front of the class the second class i barely passed but only because my teacher didn t want the whole class to fail then i started taketwo of the class earlier this year it started okay a lot of work and not enough time but i managed to survive but then on the second week or so i got drugged at a party and stuff happened with four people but i don t remember most of it or who knew about my mental state after that i missed two classes because of doctor s appointments and trying to deal with related things after i told my boyfriend he was afraid to let me out of his sight for almost a week but i didn t mind it felt safe and i wanted that i kept trying to do well in class but it was hard with so many distractions and i didn t feel well because of the medication i went on for what had happened at the party my boyfriend has also been in school but his grades have been slipping i want to tell myself that it s not my fault he s so distracted now but i just can t find it in myself to believe it then within the last three weeks my best friends tried to hang himself unsuccessful my boyfriend is becoming increasingly depressed saying he wants me to give up on him and constantly mentioning killing himself and i m constantly thinking about how much easier it would be for me to just stop existing and trying and putting so much effort into making things better only to have them get worse now to make things better i just got my grades back for the first section of the semester and i did even worse than last semester and this time i tried to do better both of my teachers think i m suicidal and notified the school about it my parents made me start mood stabilizer meds to try to help even though i didn t want them but i didn t get a choice i feel like no matter how hard i try i can t help anyone else with their problems i know i need to try to fix myself but i have no fucking clue how and the only person i have to talk to only listens to my bullshit because i pay her to therapist i feel completely lost everything i do ends up making things worse i can t help anyone because i m too broken i can t help myself because i don t know how the only good thing i feel in my life right now is my boyfriend but his talk about killing himself don t sound much like idle threats the kind like if i wasn t there for him i don t think he d be around much longer and they scare the hell out of me i m so tired i m tired of pretending i m okay because i m really not i m tired of people caring all of the sudden now that i ve stopped pretending i m tired of feeling like i don t have a voice or a choice i m tired of feeling unloved i m tired of life
__label__suicidal,this may possibly be the final straw now before we start i am getting help i m slightly suicidal so that s why i m posting here my girlfriend of 1 month but that s besides the point broke up with me yesterday because i m  cold and mean and possessive  she said i m not healthy for her and i understand why she s a lot like me in many ways depressed has anxiety worse than me in most ways and likes a lot of the things i like even though it s a short relationship i felt a deep deeep attachment to her i would say i m in love with her she even had the same feelings but i fucked up i kept making jokes saying i m gonna kill myself and kept doing it even when she clearly didn t like it i wasn t doing it for the attention really it was a way for me to cope i guess i also kept poking fun at her for when she accidentally called me one of her friends names i d pretend to be upset whenever she would say she thought someone else was cuteeven when i could tell she wasn t serious she loved me as much as i loved her i still think she does too the day before we were cuddling and saying we love each other every 5 minutes this wasn t really like her at all during class today i kept catching her glancing at me from time to time i m going to give her space for a few days then try to talk to her in person if this fails i think i m done with life you can say what you want about it being really short of a relationship or how i m young and i ll get over it i m 18 but i really don t think i will i don t want anyone else but her i fucking love her with all of my strength heart the passion of a million suns whatever if she says no i ll respect that but i will probably be done with life

__label__suicidal,long i m sorry i called the national suicide prevention helpline twice and i feel even worse hello all i would like to share my experience with the national suicide prevention helpline and get some input on both that and the original reasons i called in but first a little about me i am a 27 year old collegeeducated female from a middleclass background i have a pretty typical story physically and emotionally abusive dad and a mom that stood by and watched all of her emotional baggage was dumped on me from the beginning from the times he would cheat to her bankruptcy she came to me to vent all of it every time i have looked out for her from the beginning always putting her above myself since she had it so much harder even getting between her and dad or her and my brother when verbal fights escalated i became a drug addict at the age of 21 opiates of course and have been battling that too anyhow she spent her entire retirement money on a house near the beach to get away from dad and took my heroinaddicted brother and his wife with her instead of me because they don t like me even though i helped her find the house and it s her house she s always said i was her favorite and her best friend although i don t believe you should be friends with your children she comes back to visit more often than not which is good because i don t really leave the house not even if i m hungry as for the rest of it very quickly last year everyone died and two years before that i made a plan that i have since perfected about killing myself overdose when my mom dies she has an endstage disease due to addiction as i couldn t bear to hurt someone as badly as the loss of a child would hurt a mother the event that set this whole thing off was her telling me she would be home one day then changing it to two days later then changing it yet again i had a sort of epiphany where i realized my entire life she has told everyone only what she thought they wanted to hear or what would keep a fuss down this included me i then realized that i was staying alive for someone who i m not entirely sure really cares all that much about me there s much more but that s the gist of it as for the helpline i know that they can only talk for a certain amount of time and both phone calls lasted less than 5 minutes i told them i was 27 my mom had lied to me one too many times and i have had a planned suicide for three years now one said why can t you be happy that she s happy at the beach while the other said what were you calling about again and as i repeated myself was cut off and told that they re open 247 both of them made me feel like it was my fault and i was being selfish i think mostly because they weren t listening i m obviously not upset that she s happy i m upset that she lies just to make things easier for herself when she alone well along now with all you good people knows how fragile i am i m not going to make this post any longer if you have any questions please post them and i will answer as soon as possible thank you for reading my postupdate hello all i appreciate each and every one of your replies it seems like those helplines aren t very helpful to some who may just be those most in need unfortunately that s how it goes someone asked why i don t leave the house often and that s because i have severe depression and panic attacks and in spite of many different medications and combinations along with therapy none of it seemed to work in the decade between my diagnoses and when i lost my health insurance last year so ers are out of the question i m glad i guess that others have been through similar events and grateful they could keep me company during a time of need just a simple reply means so much during stressful situations so to all those lurking you never know how much you might help someone with one minute of your time thank you

__label__suicidal,my diary log as of so far okay my first time writing this i know i will sound like some emo whiny attention whore bitch but i need to talk about this personally since nobody really cares or can really help or really gives to fucks or stereotypes mefirst off i wish i could stop looking down on myself i can t do it because i m always left behind i can t stand to see others treat me different i m treated as if i m not like everyone else and it s been like that since i was young and it reminds me of those times making me feel empty and unwanted i ve tried so hard to grow up with at least a good image on myself yet i still can not grow to find my own meaning i try to make others laugh it s my root of my own happiness i try so hard to bring you and others joy yet the flame slowly dies and i can feel it but i hold on because i feel something special something wanted i feel like as if we need eachother as if we are meant to be and i m sorry if i am a dissapointment to you or came out different then you expected when i say you ve changed me and you are you are i m being honest but i can t help looking down on myself and seeing you treat others as if they re better sometimes gives me old childhood memories being the different kid the one who wasn t really wantedi would talk more but i m usually ignoredalso you i need to talk about you with the name with the b in it you don t realise how much you hurt my daily life i am now afraid to even go to school since i am looked down upon now due to your stereotypes for me although it may seem funny to you it s not to me because i have to deal with it everyday wishing i was someone different you re treating me as if i am not human which is now making me think this and nobody even knows how i feel not online not in real life because i ll be looked at differently it s already stained i can t help who i am but i know that it s possible to get to your own happinesses whether it s throwing chairs at me publicly humiltating me and even punching me hitting me breaking my things i feel happy because you re getting your own satisfactory even if i sit and i cry nobody cares to take up for me and that s how it s always going to be i ve come home broken in tears over what you ve done to me due to who i am i hurt myself and i hide it because nobody needs to have a lower opinion on myself since you re so high up there with your popularity i ve had family fights over you and it s made me paranoid to even leave my house to see you and i don t wanna go back to school to see you or others either i look down the hallway with my head down wishing nobody would look at me i hate who i am and who i ve become and i ve tried finding light in the lives of others it s slowly working i hope i can see a dim light i hope i can make it even if you stand in the way it s fine you are getting what you need you are bigger and stronger i m smaller and less cared about i have lots of reasons to be hurt for who i am i remember what it was like being hit i remember being in panic tearing up at my table and you running off laughing with your group at me and it became everyday stealing my stuff everything i didn t care i couldn t do anything i ve tried to sit with others and ask for help but you ve made me feel like i can t i ve cried and i ve died on the inside i ve tried to stand up but i m so horrible at being mean i ve lost my anger it s just faded into selfdeprivating sadness you ll never know my life outside of your jokes that affect me you ll see it as a gag to hurt the gay boy because i m always alone and have nobody it is funny it is i ve come to laugh at myself too even if i am scared of seeing you and others i know they won t help they will not help i m not to be dwelled on i remember you coming to my locker and pushing me and hitting me in the back of my head smacking my phone and getting close to me and having others stare at me as if i was a monster i ran to class crying but i had covered it up i d rather let nobody know i ve tried no outcome i ve failed as a person as a partner as a son i m truly sorrysightray i know you hate me i know i m against what you think about me but i ve come to agreeance with it even though i did nothing to you i feel like i deserve what i get from you all of the abuse the drama i deserve it even all those plans to ruin my life and kill me they were worth it i know you and your friends plan things behind my back if you want to hurt me you can you have already so why not do it again you ve pressured suicide on me and i ve tried more than twice which i know makes you truly happy to see the only person who loved you die or at least want to i m glad i can bring you the happiness you ve always wanted everyone s come to believe your rumours and i retchedly have a dark feeling for you in my heart although it s all selfbased it s my mistake to end up like this and i ve tried to fix it but your fucking selfishness ruins itto all my old friends who have left mei m sorry i ve annoyed the living shit out of you i know who i am and i know i can t help it i m not worth any of those tears you cried either if any of you did i m sorry i ve pulled this image onto myself i m not sure what i ve done yet i ve assumed and i think i m right the feelings i ve harboured were like no others with friendship putting so much in trying hard at least an effort and i get turned down treated as if i was never born or existed all of those things i ve done have ended up in ash and worthless i can t help going out and getting a memory of you or one of you it hurts me and i try to find you guys again to talk i miss you you don t miss me though i can see why you ve found better people i m replaceable and i can see it happening with many people replaced by those who hate mefrom now on i will continue my life still putting my feelings underground i ve lived up to my stereotpye anyways trying to help myself i try to ignore the pain inside and one by one part of me slowly feels distant and the smile and emotions i ve harboured are fake i can t let you know the way i feel i don t need any of your sympathy the vicious words are slowly killing me i try so hard to bring empathy and joy while hiding behind the lie that has become who i am i just can t sleep that one of you is gone and i m afraid of losing others the wounds you ve left never heal i know you won t change you ve got the same look on your face things will never be the same b i feel your pain you hurt me but i won t ever object as like a fool i will smile through the tears your own personal lovable fool time fades away like yesterday the thing i hate the most is something i can t do i can t ignore him i try to once more my voice might be able to even reach the future already collapsing your voice has surely reached me making the ignored one me the selfish one me the number one thing i hate is how i can t do anything how much of a coward i am how i give up and how selfish i am even if there is no meaning even if i understand it s not easy to admit bonds washed away by carless whitewash even when i want to live in the world there s not any kindness i hide behind the feelings of fear sinking into hope and despair who do i turn to i offer to you not knowing anything at all i continue still to walk the earth no matter how many times done comes and goes recyled though the world isn t asking for anything it s beauty harassess me making me wish i was kinder in the morning it s okay to pretend to be happy because i want to be satisfiedi want to share my feelings and i had made it into a shape yet it s been broken many times over my own faultiness and i am able to repair my own mistakes if if you had the ears that i posess i d sing you a song or at least try to straight from my heart and if you had posessed the same heart as i do then i would flood you with all the love i have but would you even feel if you are predisposed to hate me please kill me now and end the misery bi can t gain anything at allyou don t need me at all evri don t need to reach your deafened ears or to fill your heart a dissapointment i was said to be but where am i in the distant future anyways  i carried away alone wherever i run wherever i hide i am laughed at i don t dare to even look back new day 2so my nickname has been changed i m no longer something sweet just my regular name although you said that it was to prevent people mixing us up i ve noticed that it doesn t happen a lot and despite me changing it back you put it back sometimes i feel like you do it to attract other people to you so then you can say i don t have a partner but then again it s probably me overthinking i hope it s the opposite of what i m thinking i really love youday two continuedokay so what i had expected just happened i m fine to see you go i know it makes you happy even if it hurts me this explains a lot i ve given into your life and i was blinded by your love and not having any really true feelings i ve done a lot and not noticed i mean i m fine to see you go it s happened so many times it s just become something regular in my life i do feel sad and i feel remorse but your voice has surely reached me i know life will get harder it will worse things will happen but this will build up and i will keep everything special we had together even if it didn t work out although i was blinded thinking it was letting my anxieties and fears and bring people and i love down selfishly i will live oncass  today at 721 pm dude you re crazy no offense i thought iwas paranoia but    today at 721 pm i knowi love youalthough you dont love me its always going to be like this i shouldve listened to my headand all of the times i ve wrote about you to strangers asking for opinions saying that you truly loved me i can t trust anyone at all why me why meit has to be me i m so close to the edge i ve been filled with lies i remember when there used to be colors

__label__suicidal,seriously considering now for some backround i have thought of dying and how much better it would be many many times i m 37 and have been having thoughts like this for nearly my entire life outside of once or twice though it s not something i ever felt like i was serious about last night however i scared even myself it has been a bad week nothing too terrible and stuff that i know most people could and i should be able to just shrug off and keep going however it feels like certain people mainly my bossdad and sometimes my wife are actually trying to piss me off it s pretty well known to them that once i get really pissed off to the point of walking away that i end up very very depressed yet it seems like they do it on purpose anyway for example yesterday i was out on our mobile store because the regular driver quit a while back it runs on a propane generator or we can plug in to run the lights and ac unit back there i was at a site where running the cord left a trip hazard so decided against pulling out the cords and just ran the generator supposed to be there from 125 around 2pm on what is one of the hottest days of the year in south texas and the generator runs out of propane my fault in a way because i forgot to check it i don t drive this thing though it requires a cdl which i don t have one of our other drivers drives it to the site for me i drive his van and he goes about his day doing a different task while i man the mobile store so it s not an option for me to simply go fill the propane and carry on so i bring out the cords and plug in it s 2 cords this is important one cord that has a standard plug on one side and the other end is the big round 3prong plug normally found on washing machine because that s what the truck uses to plug in to the generator or the cord now this single cord by itself was not long enough so i get the second cord which i call an extension cord which has a male and female end with the round plugs so in short i plug the cord with the regular wall socket in to the wall run the cord out plug the extension cord in to that cord and plug that in to the truck pretty simple right well it didn t work and here s where all that becomes important i call my bossdad and explain the situation to him his answer is what do you mean extension cord i ve used that cord at the office before and it works i reply with yes i ve used the standard cord before and know it works but i have not used the extension cord before as far as i know it is untested and the previous driver never plugged in anyway i m guessing it s faulty so he responds i have no idea what you are talking about what do you mean extension cord what is that i ve never seen one before so i proceed to describe the two cords the same way i did above he still has no fucking clue what i am talking about this is one of the things that easily upsets me i know it probably shouldn t but it does when i explain something really fucking simple and someone just does not understand so he starts bitching at me that he doesn t have time to deal with this i say fine i ll just hang out only a couple hours left at this point i can sit in the ac of their break room and come out when people approach the truck and then go back to the ac it won t be too bad he says no that s unacceptable for the customer experience i agree to an extent but these guys need what we are there to provide so he decides instead of just taking my word it s not working that he s gonna come out and take a look bitching the whole time that he does not have time for this i agree i tell him i do not think it s going to do any good to come out but i am getting really upset at this point because he doesn t know what a damn extension cord is so he gets there realizes what it is and that it s faulty and bitches some more about having to come all the way out there decides to call the other driver back close up shop and reschedule that s fine i need to get out of there anyway i m having a really tough time not losing it at this point so i wait around another little bit for the other driver to show up swap vehicles go out through security who has to inspect the back of both vehicles and it takes some time drive all the way back across town and it s nearly 4 at this point now keep in mind that because i had to leave for this appointment at 11 and we were there from 125 i had not had lunch i ve been out in the heat for the past 2 hours and am dead tired so i am telling him this and that at this point i really just want to head home and eat instead he assigns me a task that he knows is gonna take me 23 hours what the fucking fuck i have not eaten all day i am covered in sweat i have black crap all over me and my clothes from moving those dirty cords around i had come in early that day because i had other stuff that needed to get dome before i left for the appointment and now he s wanting me to stay late with no lunch i m pissed walk out went home and sat in the shower for an hour finally went downstairs and ate dinner then wife heads off to bed after getting our daughter in bed this is where i was sitting there and really seriously considering just killing myself i was even removed because i guess it s explicit and against the rules i did not actually removed of course as i am here today but i was very close and today i am very scared of what i might do in the end i was thinking about how it would be for my wife to wake up to that she would likely lose her job as she would not be able to go due to having to deal with a dead me and getting our daughter to school or whatever else she would have to deal with so i didn t but it s the closest i have come and i am scared of myself if i had been just a little angrier or more depressed would i have carried through i don t know all i know is that i had an incident friday that really set me off then another tuesday and then this i m at my wits end these little things should not bother me so much but they do i should be able to just ignore it and carry on but i can t the scenarios play over and over in my head no matter how much i try to distract myself i go to sleep with the incidents playing in my head i dream about them the same things happening over and over i wake up with them on my mind because i was dreaming about it it won t go away and i want it to

__label__suicidal,it feels stupid to pick up the knife for a girl but 6 years of pain and heartache seem to heavy to handle when we fall in love we re usually slaves to our hormones and primal instincts which means we often become irrational i know it causes pain i ve had the feeling before however looking back on it i realise it was just not worth it in my opinion no girl can possibly be the only meaningful thing in life hope things work out for you 
__label__suicidal,note to my mom i love you this is it its the end of the road for me the feeling of overwhelming sadness is unbearable i think the world would be better off without me  nothing is worth breathing for im just a waste of resources on this planet the unmistakable feeling of being unwanted and hatred is fogging my existence you may question my decision but please remember that human beings are complicated creatures  you may think i m selfish for leaving this world without saying goodbye  leaving the people who loved me if any   its not the easiest way to end the unlimited suffering i am facing  nor the smoothest route to demolish the darkness of being lonely and rejected please don t be sad that im gone  be happy that you meant the world to me

__label__suicidal,my good friend m30 has had several breakdowns he is now distancing himself from fh and myself he s close and we don t know what to do fh and i fear one of our good friends is very close to going through with ithe s confided in us a long time ago that he s suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time we ve had several scares and dealt withwitnessed a handful of breakdowns he fell off the radar a little over a year ago for a solid day and a half after an emotional break and we went as far as breaking into his house to check on him didn t find him but his car was there turns out he self harmed and called an ambulance on himself the most recent break being 2 weeks ago since that last break he has basically stopped talked to fh they work together so that s kind of a big deal i think he went in to their office twice and worked from home all the other times since he s also taken off completely quite a bit on top of that when he does talk to fh he s been a real jerk based on what fh has told me of their conversations i ve suffered from depression myself considered suicide and used to self harm so i am familiar with a lot of this his most recent actions of being a dick to fh basically spelled it out for me he s ready he s pushing him away in order to push us out of his life and therefore make it easier fh and i are not giving up and want to help but don t know howthere was a turnaround yesterday because he came over and was at our place for a couple hours now we have a shop in our garage that he and fh work in so him coming over unannounced and going straight into the shop is not uncommon when i came home though he was inside and watching tv with fh he hung out for another hour or so but didn t say much i know that him doing this is a positive but i want to know what else to dohe had lunch with a mentor figure yesterday to discuss everything several of us know what he s going through and are basically on watch and when asked how far into this he s thought he didn t skip a beat in saying he knows how he would do it it doesn t help that he lives alone we try to get him to come over or come out with us as much as possible but him pushing us away has put a hard stop to thatplease we need help i don t know what else to do the night of his last breakdown he and i sat and talked privately he confides and trusts me more so than fh because i ve told him my past dealings with this fh is admittedly not an ideal person to help someone in this state of mind and everyone involved is aware of that not that that s a bad thing  he s just not that kind of person when we talked i was able to help him calm down but he doesn t really tell me the why s or the how s he s been looking for a committed relationship for a long time now and nothing ever works out and i know that is one of the reasons but he doesn t admit it that s not something i can help eitherhow do we help someone dealing with so much he s a very intelligent good looking individual and is praised at work he has a good core group of friends that are there for him for anything and everything his family is intact and supportive but even with all of this he s depressed thinks very low of himself and dwells on his relationship status a lot he doesn t even drink a lot if he does it s twice a week they have a gamenight that 46 guys join in and they ll drink at home during that then on friday s they have their regular spot they go to with a regular group of guys all great guys other than that he s not drinking heavily he doesn t smoke he has a dog at home which i know helps but i m growing more and more afraid that none of this is going to be enough and that he s closer than i d like to believei m sorry if i m rambling please help us help him he won t go see a professional we re all he has
__label__suicidal,it really feels hopeless to continue on at this point well i guess i should preface this with mentioning the fact that i ve desperately wanted to kill myself for the past 6 years or so barely anything has changed for the better with far more things changing for the worse as such that want to end my life has persisted ever since thenit started for me when i started experiencing bullying at school and my mother becoming abusive at school i was the target of being beaten up and constant taunts and at home my mother started to use increasingly violent punishments for smaller and smaller mistakes to make matters worse my mother would often downplay how much what she would do would hurt me or deny that it even happened and then punish me for lyingsince then my mother has decreased in the violence of what she did and the frequency but she still does it for a good few years my mother became increasingly not involved in my life with my dad becoming the parent who took care of me more thankfully unlike my mother he wasn t the kind of parent who would hit his child eventually my dad became very sick he eventually moved away to live with his other family members because he was having a very difficult time in our household for reference my mother was frequently saying that he was faking how much pain he was inhim falling over and she would frequently go on rants about how god willed for him to get cancer because he was a wicked man she would have these rants when he was able to hear themmy dad was the only person really protecting me from her nowadays it s been hell i honestly can t take it anymore i don t see any way out aside from just killing myself i had tried contacting the authorities in the past but they only took away the thing i used to self harm and did nothing else except imply that they thought i was manipulativelying to them i genuinely was scared for my life because my mother was threatening to kill me and they did nothingi can t take it i really can t it feels so hopeless at this point nothing makes me happy i have no friends and my home life is a living helland well to make things just that tiniest little bit more shit i m trans and well my mother is quite transphobic she refers to trans people as it and thinks it s disgusting for them to use hormones i m not going to be able to leave this household for another few years and even then i doubt i m going to be able to get away my family is not in a good financial situation so i doubt i m going to have enough money to even possibly move outit really seems like the best option i have is killing myself nothing is getting any better in my life so it really seems like it s the only thing i have left i don t want to have to keep going through this honestly i should ve killed myself alreadysorry that this was long winded poorly formatted and poorly organized my apologizes

__label__suicidal,hopeless i posted here a little while ago but here is the outline of my story the last 3 and a half years have been hell my head hurts my face feels congested and blocked my ears crackle pop block and hurt with every swallow loud noises make my eardrums rattle like a blown out speaker after seeing herbalists ents nutritionists allergists osteopaths doctors and dieticians i was no closer to finding out why i had these symptoms i was becoming a nervous wreck as i cut out dairy sugar wheat chocolate alcohol and basically every pleasurable food except for fruit i was given every anti allergy and sinus drug spray tool and device you could think of nothing was helping it i was stuck in bed feeling more depressed with my constant head cold like symptoms feeling lethargic sad and desperate my anxiety was becoming horrendous i was developing ocd because of the fear of touchingsmellinginhaling everything in case that was why i was having these symptoms my doctor told me i could be like it for life and i may never get better we finally found an ent who took me seriously 18 months later he scanned my sinuses and ears and said they are perfectly clear and diagnosed a jaw issue finally i had a reasoning a medical reason for feeling like i did tmj i matched every symptom perfectly and there was hope we found a dentist who specialised and he ordered a scan which showed significant damage to the tm joints and degeneration a heavy programme of physio rehabilitation splint therapy and soft food followed as i finally got out of my lower hopeless moods and anxieties and found a path to normality the pain got worse and worse as i underwent treatment and i went on painkillers daily i was miserable but hopeful he retired last christmas and i saw a colleague who referred me to the surgeon they use he said the issue hadn t resolved at all non invasively and now it was time for surgery i m in the uk and the waiting lists over here for the nhs are exterminate so we had to self fund lying in bed the night before i knew i would either get my life back or it would fail and i would feel worse than ever the operation came went and 4 months later i ve not seen any improvement and have now developed severe anxiety and ptsd symptoms after collapsing 2 days after the surgery the nurses put it down to taking off the bandages and the heavy cocktail of drugs i was on but it was terrifying my head felt pressured things felt surreal and it shook me i now keep having panic attacks ever since my anxiety daily is 100100 i m severely depressed in pain things feel surreal and i m forgetful i m seeing a therapist who is trying to help me manage my pain and although she is so lovely and helpful it just is so tough talking about it i m empty broken hopeless and sad i m waiting for the next anxiety attack living through the days terrified of my anxiety avoiding everything because i m now not 100 sure what is causing the symptoms and waiting to go back to sleep things are a blur and my therapist said i am severely anxious and depressed and struggling to find positivity as well as having flashbacks nothing is getting better and i don t know what to do anymore thank you to whoever reads this 
__label__suicidal,i m weirdly attracted to the idea of being a jane doe not only do i want to die i also want to be one of those unknown or forgotten dead people like sure i might get a bit of attention after the police or whatever ask people if they recognize my corpse or whatever but then after that i would be no one just a jane doe a decomposing body no one cared or will ever care about but with the number of blood test i ve done in my life many hospitals have my dna so  not gonna happen 
__label__suicidal,hurting keep having these strange dreams wanting to end it all but i know if i give in will i truly reach happiness or will it be just an empty void like my life currently is going through life trying to fake being happy not to worry anybody knowing deep down inside i am hurting trying to find myself but finding nothing the therapist i was seeing didn t get it his logic was well if you would just go out talking to people you would be happier no that s not how it works i want to meet people but its hard when you are so miserable that you just want to be alone and you got people trying to talk to you that don t get it i see all my friends have moved on in life and are living on their own while i am stuck living at home barely scraping by working at most 7 months out of the year because of my seasonal status at my job can t even get a full time job it blows i used to be able to say it will be worth it in the end i graduated seven years ago and still am living at home never went to college i am over 400 pounds i know i need to lose weight but its hard when you just don t care what happens i have tried reaching out to my parents but they don t understand my dad is just like deal with it everyone has problems it s life how can you say that to someone especially your own son but i should have seen that coming he has no sympathy for anybody his logic is if somebody is that depressed and wants to die to just do it little does he know that him saying that cuts like a knife his views on therapy are it s a waste of time and money said all therapists are just people looking to exploit weakminded people not necessarily true i will hopefully get through this in one piece and not do anything drastic 
__label__suicidal,the only thing stopping me from killing myself is someone to take the plunge with i never wanted to be singled out in fact i hate standing out making an impression being noticed existing perhaps this is the reason i never wanted to kill myself on my own it s been 5 years since i first attempted and failed and i know the only reason why i cowered at the last minute was that there wasn t someone there to jump with me am i a romantic at heart wanting to add tragedy to my short misled life perhaps am i a coward most definitely my mental illness has followed me across life and i can no longer bare to exist with it i have received attempts of help in many forms but it s gotten to be an embarrassment for me and my family now their daughter with a formerly bright future has only wasted their hard earned money and i feel only shame for what i am my attempts at being independent only landed me in hospital and my attempts of being a student or employed led to me having a psychotic episode and i had to quit both i wish i didn t want to achieve i wish i didn t care i am now a 22 year old woman in debt with no degree no qualifications and no prospects my beauty is also fading and this one thing i could say i had will be no more some people just aren t meant to be on this earth i wasn t meant to survive the only reason i survived was through modern science by the process of natural selection i should have never existed i try every day to show my worth in some way but all around me i can only see the drain i am having emotionally and financially on their lives i have been given pills of all nature and they only lessen the pain by 20 at the most i am in therapy and have been for years i exercise daily i eat well i push myself to do things the voices tell me not to every single minute i still fail i ve tried enough now i just wasn t meant to be here once i find my partner then i will be saying hello to the clouds 
__label__suicidal,nobody actually would seriously know or care if i was dead i m thirty years old now i was never one to have many friends i m not the type that adds everyone i meet only for five minutes on facebook so they can show they have over one thousand friends just to elevate their social status nobody can possibly be friends with that many people which is why i m more reasonable and only included those that i ve known for years which is under 40 friends for over a year now nobody has interacted with me on there and i ve been active on there almost everyday in some way i ve commented on friend s posts which go unliked or replied to they don t comment on my posts and they especially don t return my personal messages i even invited some out but no replies my gps was linked on there and one day i went to the emergency room for a accidental overdose i posted a witty but somewhat serious post on my profile that said something like oops i almost kicked the old bucket folks pay attention when taking any medications so as not to overdose like me as it s not pleasant and none of my friends committed on that i know they re active everyday and commenting on other people s posts it was a few days after that when i returned and logged back in my point is nobody would know or even care that i was dead but i m sure if they somehow found out i had died that they would try to get symphony from other friends about it just so people could focus on themselves it would be like hey you know so and so died then the other would tell them they are sorry when in actuality the friend hasn t interacted with me for years so my point is if they found out they wouldn t actually be upset or sorry i was dead they would only use it to get symphony for themselves but it wouldn t even get that far because to them as far as they know i m already dead just some loser that keeps popping up on facebook s feed i even phone texted some and they don t return my messages and i m not spamming them with texts either if that s what you think i recently messaged those i had messaged before jokingly asking if they lost their fingers but no reply and i can see they read it but they choose to ignore me and they all are on messenger a lot even the one i considered my best friend and whom i confided in i was feeling suicidal months ago no longer talks to me and the thing is i truly have little to live for i m in a bad situation i even came out and told them i was a virgin and never actually kissed or been kissed or experienced any kind of love at all because i was feeling suicidal and no longer cared to hide it we did talk at the time and a few weeks after but we haven t talked for months now or i should say they haven t been interested in talking to me for months now i guess it s all about social status people see nobody is commenting or posting on your facebook so they see you don t have any friends so they avoid you i can t go into my life situation but i assure you i have little to live for only pets no gf or kids on full disability for physical reasons so i have everything going against me and nothing for me
__label__suicidal,i m available lets chat anybody that needs someone to talk to can contact me maybe i can help you see things from a different perspective in need of a friend dont hesitate im just an average 35 yr old guy from florida
__label__suicidal,this is a positive one a lesson learned like most people here i blame myself for my situation more i can blame anyone else i ve always been very bad with anxiety to include hospitalizations research says it s from a shitty home life and parents that didn t live up but a natural side effect of that much anxiety is trying to control so much in your lifethis ruins relationships i m in love with a free spirit we ve been dating and figuring things out for 8 years now when she leaves to get space it kills me but we both know it s from me getting too controlling when you do this it s tough cause it will drive people away and even tho you re wellmeaning and trying to help it almost push her into the arms of another man who seemed less stressful and controlling it sucked i subscribed here and had daydreams of shooting myself but time passed and she was faithful and i promised to work on not being controlling but i realized something new to me while i was in that phase suicide is the ultimate desperate method of trying to get control it s getting the final word in so you can control other people s thoughts the idea at least to me always was that will make her wish she had appreciated me but the important reality is that it is actually just the fastest way to make her forget you you will not go down as a hero and her heart will move on ironically suicide is a short term solution instead you could take the tough long road of learning to be okay without the comfort of control and that s going to have a much bigger impact on her life she will never forget that and you have a fighting chance of actually being the easy going guy she knows you can be then you can be happy and a teammate to her and the anxiety will move right through you i hope this helps someone that may be feeling like i was thanks for readingtldr suicide for control is a short term solution 
__label__suicidal,i want to die because of my parents but they re also the reason i haven t commited suicide yet long post throwaway obviously19m currently in tears while typing this i feel like my parents would be so much better off without me they say they love me but don t show that in actions they seem to love my older brother much more even though they deny it i ve been saying it since i was like 14 but they never wanted me to think that i love them a lot and they are the most important thing i possess yet i feel like they don t love me at all i always get to do the dirty work boring things and always get shouted at meanwhile my brother is so perfect such a great son which is what they say at family activities they say jokingly that i m like the kid who they ve lost hope in they have been saying that since i was like 12 and they always say it s a joke and nothing serious but it always haunted me about myself i have some good friends not lonely not ugly not stupid hopeless etc i love being with my friends and most people would describe me as a nice guy who is happy nobody knows that i can t really remember the last time i was happy it s like a 247 mask i wear pretending to be happy partying going out hanging out i just feel very useless time to time and i feel my friends and family would think i d be the last person to end my life i think most people at my schoolcity would think i m very happy meanwhile my mental health is fucked up i ve been having suicidal thoughts for like 15 years now but i don t like the idea of shocking my loved one friends and family and never be able to see them anymorethings went even worse when my dog passed away a few months ago he was besides my human friends probably my best friend back when i was younger and didn t have many friends he was always there i miss him every dayi don t know what to do i think i couldn t go through the process of physically killing myself but i also don t find much joy or happiness in my life i wish i could just skip to being 65 and being retired nobody knows how i really feel and i have nobody i could ever talk about this because even that would shock the shit out of them as i have never ever shown this i hope there is a way out besides killing myself 
__label__suicidal,glad i didn t throw away my suicide note i don t think i could handle writing another right now
__label__suicidal,i think i m ready to go but i m too scared to really do it first off i d like to acknowledge that my problems are probably quite insignificant when compared to others that come to this board i should be happy i m 18 whole life ahead of me right i come from a wealthy family i got the chance to grow up abroad i attend a fairly decent college in the us i m not disabled mentally or physically i have a family that cares about me i don t have an identity sexual gender etc that might distance me from my peers i m not physically unattractive or so i ve been told i dunno but i think i m done with life also i d like to apologize for the damnnear essay that follows what else would you expect from a humanities majori ve felt this way for a long time but i ll skip most of that time period and start in high school throughout the majority of high school i never really had any friends which is entirely my fault towards the end i made a couple of closeish friends but they re gone now plus i think they were only there because they knew how unhappy i was i think i only really made it to college alive because i was really fairly dependent on alcohol in the months leading up to me coming here but now in college of all places that crutch is gone so far i have absolutely no friends in college i have absolutely no one i can talk to every time i ve even slightly mentioned anything about my emotional state people get scared and run off i ve been fairly reliant on my friends from high school to talk to but i am almost certain that they ve tired of me well i m absolutely sure one of them has and she was the only one that really mattered to me now i just lie to everyone and tell them that i m ok i m not i ve tried to hang myself twice before but both times i panicked right before i lost consciousness i ve overdosed on my meds which i ve stopped taking three times it was zoloft so i knew it wouldn t be fatal i ve got a noose hidden in my room i ve put it around my neck a couple times already and tested if the knot will hold i just need one more thing to push me over the edge i can t help but feel that the rest of my life has nothing in it really i know that some of my thoughts which because of their complete lack of reason i won t go into are just the depression talking but i know that i m not going to be cut out for anything great no girl will ever find me as a viable option romantically have you ever had a girl give you the yeahno thanks look so i know i m going to end up alone or in some passionless relationship in which my supposed partner will have decided to just settle for less if you can t tell based on the lack of structure in this paragraph i m not even sure what point i m trying to get at anymore i just know i don t want to be here i m sorry to waste your time if any of you bothered to read this far

__label__suicidal,looking for reasons to live i m 18 years old living in the uk and to put it bluntly i no longer have any reasons to live i m not a wellliked person in general probably my own fault i don t particularly make effort to befriend people and never like talking to anyone outside of my immediate small group of friends in this small group of friends i have no one i feel any particular closeness to no one to really talk to about anything personal hence why i m using reddit just over a year ago i was left by someone that was in many ways my best friend probably the only person i have ever been able to really talk to after this long period of time being apart despite efforts to distance myself from her i am still pathetically in love with her it s hard to illustrate through text how that feels but to summariseagony within a few weeks she will have moved away and i will likely never speak to her again added to this the fact that since we broke up i have not been able to even successfully secure a single date and i have had to frequently hear from mutual friends how happy she is and all about what new guy she is datingbut the thing that really breaks my heart is the fact that my own family don t love memy mom is someone i have never gotten along with and she makes it apparent that she wants me to leave home as soon as possible to the point where she has threatened to throw me out if necessary currently i cannot afford to leave despite working full time i also have a brother and sister i wouldn t consider myself close within conclusion i have no close friends the only person i ve loved will soon be out of my life forever and each night i come home to hear my family tell me i need to leave home soon it s hard to see a point in life anymore
__label__suicidal,i m getting closer with each day like the title says every day i come closer to taking my own life mostly because i don t want to work for the rest of my life i just don t see the point i m going to work for the next 50 to 60 years at manual labor and dead end jobs only to struggle to get by and end up dying in a hospital room i can t afford that isn t a life i ve ever wanted i ve been thinking this way since i was little and i can t see another option besides suicide if i keep going like this i ll end up killing myself if i quit working i ll be homeless and my girlfriend will leave me which again leads me to suicide the meds i have taken over the years haven t helped even a little therapy hasn t helped either because all people say is to get a new job or to find happiness in my work but that s the problem i hate working it s pointless filling my bosses pocket by trading in my life for money if i m miserable and have everything that is actually good in my life few things overshadowed with dreading work not to mention the anxiety i have for just knowing i have to go it s not worth it and i can t think of anything to solve the problem i want to live and be happy obviously but that just isn t going to happen as long as i have to work but in order to to live i have to have money it s and endless cycle i want out of i tell everyone i m not gonna kill myself but i m not sure if that holds true anymore i can feel my will power draining away every day i don t feel like i ll be here much longer and that scares me not because i m scared of death but because i don t want to hurt my family and friends

__label__suicidal,i have no meaning in my life no friends and no hopes for a better future started uni this fall and it s really stressful and i have no goals with my education so nothings really motivating me i really like the subject but it s just not worth the effort i think i expected too much going in to this i thought i was going to meet people who were like me i guess i forgot that even if those people existed i wouldn t get along because i barely open my mouth unless someone is asking me questions in middle school people harassed me whenever i said anything so i gradually got quieter and quieter till i just didn t say anything and i haven t really recovered from that i ve basically been socially isolated till now i ve been struggling for a long time and it s a miracle i managed to move to start uni i feel like this is where it ends though i m so close to giving upi don t think my life has ever felt worth living for i ve always escaped into fantasies about things being good it s lead me to make poor decisions chasing weird fantasies i ve realized this now though and i m trying to spot when i have them but i don t dare to dream about things anymore i want a nice car and house but that s not going to fix anything i think what i need is to better myself so that i can have healthy and meaningful relationships and a source of income it s just so difficult and i honestly just want to end it i m so tired of life

__label__suicidal,i won t kill myself but i need reasons to live hey so i think about killing myself a lot i won t kill myself since i know what kind of pain that would inflict on those around me i also don t think it s worth it to distance myself from those people before killing myself as it d cost a lot of time and effort and when they d find out they d still be hurtbut i feel zero motivation to live the only things i do in life are to serve others to ease their time in the world i have a job that keeps me occupied a few days a week sometimes i hang with friends i ll read watch stuff and play games occasionally but this is me trying to pass the time it feels like chores same thing with sports or even eating i don t feel motivated to care much for myself although i do eat healthy as i don t want to be too much of a burden on this planet eitheri feel like i m a burden a lot i let a lot of friendships go without attention but those friends don t seem to mind that either when i do spend time and energy it s somewhat appreciated but there doesn t seem to be a lot of will to reciprocatemaybe i m annoying to them or otherwise rather avoided by people maybe i don t show how shitty i feel about life in general i don t knowi ve come here to ask what you think there is to live for i think we as humans cause so much harm to everything and everyone around us inadvertently or not that it s better to not exist

__label__suicidal,don t know how to keep going any more hi i don t really know how to start this i just need to get this all down so people know what i m feeling and why and if there really is any chance for me to get better and if anyone knows how i can be helpedi m sorry that it s so long abd whiny and probably seems disconnected but every little thing adds up even though i know this will miss out so much and things that i don t feel comfortable sharing and i m sorry it s written weirdly and i might make it hard to read i just don t have the energy to write properly and know that if i try to i will never be able to start or finish becayse that s how it s been for me until nowi just don t see a way out of being hopeless like this i m a trans girl and my mental health and everything around me has been getting worse and worse for so longi have trichotillomania and it used to show itself like it does in most people when i was younger and i developed a bald patch because of it but because of my dysphoria when i started growing facial and body hair it quickly turned into plucking and pulling that as wellbut when the hair started getting darker and thicker i couldn t control how much damage i did to get them out so now my face is covered with scars from digging in with tweezers for hours every day i just wanted to be able to be pretty and confident with my appearance but now i never will be i always have been unhappy with how i look but during the times i hadn t got as scarred and stay clean for long enough i was happy with how i looked but now i don t even have that i ve researched stuff about how to get over trich but it s made for people that are plucking hair they don t want to lose for me i need that hair to be gone even without ocd i wouldn t be able to live properly as myself when i have hair growing out of my face shaving isn t good enough nd i can t afford hair removal i ve spent the last year or more almost completely inside so far longest time without stepping out once is six months i can t be seen like this and even when i can stop and heal for long enough for makeup to help me go out it s still so hard just being trans makes others see me as a freak let alone everything else i have no contact with my family who i ran away from more than a year ago because it wasn t good for me especially my mum who lied to gaslighted and blackmailed me as well as sabotaging my chance of getting help from the gender clinic even if they didnt seem to want to help anyway ive tried different medications for my depression but everything made me feel weird and worse so i couldn t stand to keep taking them people say that lsd can help but every time i ve done it i ve had at best a mildly uncomfortable trip but my worst led to me going to hospital and traumatised me worse than anything i can remember but i ve taken it a lot because it at least means this life is different at least for a while i ve been in some relationships but i found out about something called relationship ocd that i think describes me quite well and is what lead to most of my break ups my last girlfriend was the first person i could see in real life and i always looked forward to her visits and she was so good to me but after the bad trip i lost the ability to love like that so i had to leave her and now she hurts too much to talk i miss her a lot i didn t want to hurt her i only have a few other online friends but they have lives of their own and can t talk to me much i ve forgotten how to talk to people other than them and how to make friends i used to make lots of friends and talk to loads of people even if only really online but now i can t do it at alli used to have a lot of electronics and stuff to keep myself entertained at least but even though i know to treat my things well everything has broken and i don t know why and i cant afford to fix anything i live on disability and housing benefits and what s left after food and everything being delivered goes to collecting trading cards because it means that i at least have something to look forward to and almost enjoy and there s always a chance of something good a chance i don t feel i really get in any other area of my life it gives me something to focus on even if my ocd makes collecting toxic sometimes and i get self conscious for feeling childish but at least it s something i wish i could save to fix things or get a laptop or something so i could make art again or play games but without lots of small things to look forward to to keep me going i would suffer a lot i once saved up for a switch by starving myself and selling things that i didn t really want to sell so that i could enjoy something new but it and the replacement were both faulty and when i traded it in cex took the trade in price down the day that i arrived there and then put the price down again because i had a screen protector on it so i lost a lot of money on that i feel like i m not really allowed to be happy or have good thingsi went to pride pretty soon after i left my family but i got spit on by someone there almost as soon as i arrived and that was a long time before the hate group arrived feels like nowhere accepts mei haven t made any friends since i ve moved here other than my roommates but i did try talked to someone online and it went really well and was supposed to go to a meet up together with some of their friends but when i arrived they all didn t say a word to me and after they finished their drinks just left me alone and i really made an effort i was supposed to move out last month with the roommate i get on with better but nowhere would accept me because i don t work so i m stuck where i am and they moved out the other roommate isn t a bad person but they had anger outbursts and pushed and broke things in the house when i had moved in not long ago and i never really got over being scared of her i once attempted suicide but was found before i had taken many pills i went to the hospital anyway and said that i need help and that i think it would be best if i were to be sectioned but they said that if i kill myself it s my responsibility and they refused to help meone of my online friends recruited some of her friends that are good at helping others and know what to do and are quite good activists and stuff like that and one of them is the reason i was able to run away at all but after a while they all seemed to give up on me they knew how bad it was and said they d help and then nothing i know they do a lot and i don t expect them to drop everything they do for me and i appreciate what they have done but it hurt more to be dropped like that than not told would be helpedi feel like i m not allowed to be happy when i was a kid i got bullied a lot and especially when i was in primary school spent at least one year with no friends at all and when i did get happy or excited i ended up extremely ill which i think still happens now i once ended up in hospital the night before my birthday and i always got ill somehow before most good thingsi was in college for a year and a bit i got a distinction in my first year but knew i wouldn t be able to cope in a level 3 course because i barely got through that so i took another level 2 in something else but i got kicked out because i couldn t handle it a lot of the time when people try to help me they think i m trying to be difficult and get frustrated and give up on me but i promise i do my best it s just that so little seems to work for meall i ve been able to think about lately is self harm and suicide wanted to kill myself since i was 8 only reason i haven t started cutting again is don t have anything shark enough and usually too scared to try and kill mysskf but so close to breaking point don t know what to do i really do try my hardest to make things better and i know my best isn t that good but i don t feel like i deserve this life i always try my best to be good even if i don t always succeed i don t know what else to do i want to be able to be happy and be confident and go outside and be accepted and have s life and friends i can share good times with i really miss going outside 
__label__suicidal,eugenicist here i think it s time well i ve worked it through intellectually i m pretty much done on this earth i have contributed a little to society not very much but what i could through some serious analysis and through the process of natural selection i know that i am not fit for reproduction i am flawed physically and genetically there is absolutely nothing that i can contribute to the species via the continuance of my genetic line i have drained society my family beyond the point of my worth i know the standard arguments i know what people always say but there is a simple biological truth natural selection is natural and it is unforgiving i am not fit to reproduce and i am not fit to survive but due to the transhumanist reality that we live in i continue an unnatural existence i think it s time to return to the natural order it s time to go

__label__suicidal,what to do next i m 19 years old i just graduated high school in the spring i have struggled with depression on and off since 2010 but since spring of 2016 my life has been in a downward spiral august 2016 i moved out of my parents house two days before the start of my senior year of high school i spent all of that school year commuting 1hr plus to school all the while working full time to pay for somewhere i could live my grades suffered and when the time to apply to colleges came around i was left with one place that would take me and it was the school i least wanted to attend i sucked it up the rest of the school year and enrolled in summer courses at said college but i never attended a single class i just took advantage of the free counseling for students the psychologist there diagnosed me with borderline personality and major depressive disorder i came clean about the diagnosis to my parents and asked for their help i deferred my fall admission to the winter to take some time off and get right but just this morning my parents with two police officers at their sides kicked me out based on fear that i was going to be violent i have little money left because i spent it to enroll in summer classes no job no car and no place to go i tried to hang myself earlier today but i couldn t bring myself to fully commit

__label__suicidal,44 years old and i can t handle aging so i m vain i used to be very pretty and now i see my body changing and it depresses me so much i don t have a job so it s not like i can make money to change my body back to its former glory i could try exercising and dieting but again you need money to eat right i do walk 8000 to 10000 steps a day but it hasn t done anything for my body i ve had a good life though i opened a successful boutique which then went under due to long term street construction i did well as a model and even as a vet assistant i play violin and draw better than average but not so well that i can make a career out of my talentsbelieve me i ve tried i can t hold down a vanilla job and have been fired so many times due to my lack of people skills i really have a hard time with authority figures and corporate politics i just can t play the game to get ahead i ve had so many traumatic jobs where my boss would either verbally or sexually harass me or sabotage and steal my work i m just tired and i feel guilty for living and making my husband support me i never chose to be born and i have no idea why i was even brought into this world i ve always felt bewildered by human beings and life in general i just want to leave my aging physical body and not have to worry about superficial material things anymore i can t stand the fact that i have to tolerate a job to make money to live out my days aging i ve tried so many diets and body hacks to change my body nothing works in fact any real hardcore exercise makes me gain weight because my adrenals are so worn out i went temporarily blind on a raw vegan diet i don t know how some women can stay so beautiful and young looking their techniques just don t work on me part of me wants to fight this voice that lulls me into committing suicide part of me says there are ways to change my body and that god wouldn t give me this body to hate it there is a way for me to make some kind of supportive income so i don t have to rely on my husband hope is so seductive maybe i can find a way to fix this life and somehow enjoy it again wouldn t that be nice thanks for reading this i appreciate your time i hope you re not considering ending your physical existence there must be a reason we are encouraged to live our lives out as fully as we can there must be a reason why suffering happens the tiredness has to stop because i choose to make it go away life really is dictated by our thoughts so the more i wallow in this misery the more i create it that s how it works and it sucks because it s really easy for me to just surrender to the misery and live in the pit it feels so familiar to be miserable because i could blame my father for beating me as a kid i could give into the misery of surviving several sexual assaults when i was a little girl no one would question why i decided to end my life i won t kill myself today because i decided to hang on to the hope that i can change my body for the better and find a way to make a decent income it s out of curiosity to see how my life will turn out i can always kill myself if it gets really bad i always have that choice

__label__suicidal,pointless life anyone want to discuss how life is just pointless and doesn t mean shit
__label__suicidal,a ridiculous story about our virginity this is a very weird and unbelievable story but that s because it will lack context in a way and that s because i have to censor a certain important detail of this story my story is actually longer than this so it s shortened i ve always dreamt of having a relationship and having sex i dreamt of having sex every day and night at age 10 i already had weird fantasies and such i was always attracted to fictional characters and dreamt of them a lot so at age 15 almost 16 when it was valentinesday i got a partner i was happy but i had to really focus on her in my life she needed me in a way i was so busy it was so hard to love her but i did my best to this day i d still take a bullet for her she s so important that i choose to suffer with her remember that because that ll be relevant later also i ll explain what it means first when she can t go to a restaurant with me i just won t go when i step on her feet accidentally i step on mine when it s raining and i know she s outside not protected from the rain i won t protect my self from the rain either it s just things like that so we didn t have sex until later in our relationship because i just wasted for the right moment when we re both fully sexually mature so when we re fully grown it was only limited to me fingering her giving her oral and me receiving oral it s fun but it did miss something i didn t think much of it we ll have piv sex some day we both weren t really ready for it as it s a bit too intense for the both of us doesn t matter we ll just have other sexual contact in the mean time yes i was super optimistic about it i was 100 sure that it would happen some day and honestly i m more of a pessimist always i expect the worst but i put all my optimism in this because i was excited for it life went fine in a way i had minor depressions and sometimes small mental breakdowns and such sometimes i tried having sex with her but it just couldn t work that s when the bad evening hit i was envious of others and i was seriously pissed life was sometimes hard for me in a way and i ve had a bit of a trauma in the past and i think this was the last straw in a way i became very depressed that evening but i still had a lot of optimism i ve asked for advice and tried it that evening she was really into it i failed like usual the problem is my dick is too big for her or rather i hate to say it because it seems like i m blaming her body but her vagina just happens to be really small i don t even have a big sized dick i think not that i ever wanted a big dick anyways for me that always seemed like an useless achievement that night she really didn t like the fact that i couldn t do it i felt ashamed and felt sad for the both of us she was really pushy for me to try it again but i just wanted to sleep slowly my optimism drained quickly during these months i don t know the name of my depression but apparently it worsens over time and we both feel it i also became more envious everytime i failed i just had some kind of mental breakdown i was crying so much during these months i also got more and more information because i ve asked others they were all nice and trying to be helpful but their behavior towards me changed they started insulting me because of how absolutely ridiculous this was they were mad at me and they have emotionally hurt me so much i have never felt so bad in my life i swear i am still filled with hatred what they said i depended on a guy because he tried to help me like he said but at the end of every message he said well i got to go now there s an angel waiting in my bedroom this his way of saying i have what you don t hahaha i begged for him to stop but i depended on him so i still tried to listen yet he kept doing it until i blocked him nobody had hurt me so much in my life not even my mother who is absolutely horrible to everyone in the house really it s worse than you think it is everyday i think of him i have never been so hurt by anything i would prefer to be stabbed or even raped i genuinely felt suicidal because of him i can t take it why do all the bad humans get the good things i ve never done anything wrong trough all these months i have been trying everything i could yet a whole group told me i don t even deserve it i am so fucking envious of him i d do but hurt my girl to be in his situation there s also one thing i have to live with my girl will die of a disease she has in a few years that means i will live longer than her even if they admitted it was gross of them to say they told me to wait to have sex for my next partner but that s not even my goal it s my goal to have sex with her not anyone else even if you gave me the hottest partner i would decline not even for infinite money i am envious of every couple i see as i know 100 they can have sex i get pissed by every time sex gets mentioned i get more depressed every day this is important i also do this for her this isn t just lust i want her to experience it too that s why i will never have sex with anyone else remember this whole i suffer with her thing if she dies a virgin i will too that said when she dies i ll end myself every other couple can do this together yet we can t that alone may have just triggered this whole thing sex is special it s something you just don t miss in your life time and think about it dying a virgin is probably one of the worst things to ever happen you ll miss out on something that many couples do together for fun so much we only have one life and missing this is just so sad nobody deserves this fate absolutely no one i really do not see her as a sex object i love every part of her her personality her body her movements her everything it s just that i m hit with these curses first we can t have sex together second for some reason sex is important to us especially to me the most my depression is really serious i have become aggressive and don t enjoy anything anymore absolutely if you re still confused why it s so important sometimes you just think something is important there s a lot of humans who will tell you this when your animal dies it s just an animal get a new one it s kind of like this we all value different things and let me remind you it s done against our will i honestly don t want to leave my girl alone in this world but if i found a gun the urge to end myself immediately would be great i really care for her but my life feels so shit and unlucky that i can t take it anymore i ve always been paranoid and fearful so i don t dare to kill myself in another way i just wish we could both have our moment just once if we had it just once i ll be grateful forever that is all i want surgery won t work because she doesn t want to be changed as she s afraid of it and i myself have no idea how to even have such a surgery happen to myself and one thing i can t tell anyone about this about everything i just said i mean she isn t mentally ill as proven by the doctors here yet it s still in the files because there was a mistake it had something to do with her disease that ll kill her in a few years according to a very strict law in where i live i am not allowed to have sex with her nor be in a relationship with her i am just sick of life i just want us to have our happy little moment that s all my goal is so fucking simple yet i don t get it even though i spent so much energy optimism and time into it yet everyone else does it effortlessly i am no longer optimistic and i hate absolutely every human i don t really want to live any more i just i just wanted that one minute of easy happiness together that is all just because all of this i have a worsening depression ruining both of our lives it affects my whole mind it feels like it affects my intelligence i lose the ability to read sometimes even i go crazy from time to time i am suicidal because of our lack of quality in our lives please let me make something sure again i m not a selfish fuck who s just horny that said this also affected my libido i lost the interest in sex for a while completely i don t even try having sex with her any more we re beating a dead horse i care about her in a nonsexual way it s just unfortunate for me that it holds so much value to me and if we ever had sex i wouldn t even care if i never had sex again i just want the experience with her and that s it i want us both to experience it she needs to enjoy it and i will but no just like everything in life luck fucks me over sounds edgy and kind of makes you cringe but if luck was a human i d do everything to torture this piece of shit we don t deserve this i was happy and optimistic once 
__label__suicidal,struggling a bit if i were more rational i think i would be in a better place right now i go to a toptier school and i m on track to finish my degree in a year despite these accomplishments i still feel like an utter failure i don t enjoy my majors and i feel as if i m living a life that has been projected onto me i m asian american and while i can go on longwinded tangents on how much i think the model minority myth is bullshit i still feel ridiculously burdened and pressured by it i don t have a great relationship with my parents but i still have that desperate need to obtain a certain  success  that is by their terms i am  successful  by their terms but for this i ve sacrificed my mental health happiness social life and so many experiences that i can t relive as a caveat  i have been suicidal in the past while i am struggling right now i certainly am not at my lowest point i got a bit drunk after hearing about daca and am just a crumpled up napkin of a mess right now

__label__suicidal,19f long term livein boyfriend packed up and left while i was at work haven t eaten in 5 days just dropped out of school seizures are getting worse trying to decide between inpatient or just killing myself hey allit just feels good to get this out i understand this isn t a relationship subreddit but the context is necessary here we ve been dating since 2015 long distance then lived together for over a year the relationship was honestly perfect we treated each other extremely well and there was nothing to complain about he has bipolar and depression i have anxiety and depression i guess both of our fatal flaws were never seeing a therapist we always figured we could help each other through our mental health we never really took our mental illnesses out on each othertwo months ago i had an ugly jealous feeling in my gut to check the messages he had a year ago with a mutual friend of ours jane he had a thing with her before he and i met and for the first part of our relationship she was really friendly with me and him but something always felt off to me i did what i d never done before and read his messages with her found out for the first 4 months of our relationship he was basically cheating on me with jane asking her to come over for netflix and chill saying i love you complimenting her saying but i m not a cheater though lol in the same conversation they would then talk about how great i was total brainfuckafter reading that i went on a drive this was the first time i had ever felt angry at him i called my best friend hysterical saying how much i hated him and i just wanted to die she talked me down and about an hour and a half later i come home my nowex realizes i read his messages and responds to my tears with a scoff asking why i m making such a big deal out of something that happened so long ago i break down crying because i had been cheated on in a very similar situation in my last relationship he then breaks down crying about how he doesn t deserve medoesn t understand why i m with him etc i spend the rest of the night reassuring him that i m not going to leave that he isn t a bad boyfriend that i need time but i can forgive him etci guess that was the start of the endhe went from fulltime to parttime in the job he was doing extremely well at i advised against it but it wasn t my call to make and we could pay bills just fine if he went to parttime shortly after i noticed him slipping into a depressive spiral he d drink beer and play league of legends literally any moment he wasn t at work i d wake up he s playing league get back from the gym he s playing league make breakfast he s still playing league come home from work he s still playing league just with two empty bottles of booze next to him now i figured this was all just depression and i needed to let him cope so i d sit on his lap while he d play video games ask him if he s winning kiss him on the cheek whatever then the day would end we d have sex all good rightthe last month has been hell i had felt completely neglected and like i was just an annoyance to him i beat myself up so much on the inside that my anorexic tendencies started coming back my seizure disorder came back full swing there was one instance where i was so disoriented i threw up in the bed all over the sheets myself and my hair then passed out i woke up and he was sleeping on the floor while i m still covered in puke that had been sitting for 6 hours when he went to work i had to drag myself out of bed shower off puke sitting down i couldn t even stand and hose off our sheets before running out the door to work the fact he didn t even offer to help should have been a sign that he just didn t care anymorei would sit down with him often and ask how he was he always said he was fine just needed to decompress several times i was crying asking him why i felt like i annoyed him every time i talked to him and what i could do differently nothing ever changedso during that month i was hardly eating going to the gym getting a seizure every other week and still doing all the housework cooking cleaning laundry it was exhausting i dropped out today but at the time i was still a full time college student and working full time he just had a part time job and wouldn t do anything around the house to helpmy full time job has also been shitty but it provided us a place to live weird housing situation so i m sure hating my full time job and having all the stress of full time college too just made it worse but i had no other choice if i didn t work there full time there was nowhere for us to live end of storythe day he left i had another talk with him we had plans to move to another state soon so i can finish my degree at a school i ve been excited to attend which is also by his hometown i think i scared him by giving him an ultimatum and saying i wasn t sure how things are going to work if it continues like this i couldn t keep doing literally everything on top of full time work and school and my declining health he got a really weird look in his eyes and said i know i need to make some changes that night i come home from work and nearly everything of his is gone he left about a 7 sentence note his pet leopard gecko and just noshowed to his job he s fired now and went back to his hometownthe relationship was real shitty at the end but oh my god i miss him i keep getting flashbacks to all these good memories 2 years is a long fucking time and wondering what the hell i did wrong i hid my eating disorder pretty well from him so i know that wasn t it maybe i nagged maybe it was the seizures if i had known he was so miserable i would ve said fuck it to my job and college and gone anywhere he wanted done anything he wanted whatever i ve always been an extreme peoplepleaser i would have done anything to make him stayeither way this has thrown me real fucking deep into a hole of selfhatred and depression and i ve physically been unable to eat for the last 5 days he left me on wednesday it s now monday and the only thing i ve been able to consume is 10 oz of cranberry juice yesterdaymy mom wants me to go into inpatient i m thinking why waste 3 days in a hospital when now s a better time than ever to kill myself i won t have to worry about my weight about transferring my credits about

__label__suicidal,why do i feel this way and what can i do about it idk what s gotten into me i m not showing my usual signs of mania or depression i ve been suicidal before i ve sort of attempted before all times i was either manic or depressed or mixed recently i ve just stopped caring about myself and rapidly over the past week it has become more of a i actively want to hurt myself kind of thing i restarted self harming i have been thinking about suicide pretty consistently over the past few days i know it isn t a long time but i am pretty impulsive when i get this way idk what this even is though i don t want to scare anyone but i m actually starting to scare myself i play the i dare you game with myself a lot even when i am mostly just apathetic i just want to get through the night i guess none of my usual resources are around i guess this is really a metaquestion how do i know if selfdestructive me means it or if i am just bluffing myself
