There is a standard [tutorial](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html) on using FastText for text classification> 
The dataset used was acquired from the authors of the research, ‘Supervised Learning for Suicidal Ideation Detection in Online User
Content’ [Shaoxiong Ji et al., 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327557367_Supervised_Learning_for_Suicidal_Ideation_Detection_in_Online_User_Content)
